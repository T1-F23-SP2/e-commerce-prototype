I am adding the above MIT license to this project, under the assumption, that 
any Software within this repository as of this commit, is fully compatible with

Thus I do not take any responsibility, for any harm, damage or otherwise this may

request be made through the Github Issue tracker, that is attached to this repository. 
Anyone using any Software within this repository, in addition to accepting the 
attached license, are implicitly aware of this statement and accepts any
